# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning and deep learning models from scratch. Each model is implemented using basic Python libraries without relying on high-level frameworks.

## List of Models

### Machine Learning

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

### Deep Learning

1. **Multi-Layer Perceptron(Neural Network)**

## Structure

Each model is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook.

## Note

These are not the end of my projects. I will continue to make more machine learning and deep learning models from scratch, so stay tuned for updates!

You mainly only need `pandas` and `numpy` to run the files.
